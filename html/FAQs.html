            Depending on the city or state an individual applies for their birth certificate, the website changes, with each Indian state having a specific website. However, the rules are the same, and they have to coordinate through state municipal councils. Applicants have to fill up online forms with their personal information and submit the information to the website. They have to select the Municipal Council where the birth is registered since they gather the information there.
